# Environmental-Monitoring-Rover-using-Intel-Edison
Environmental Monitoring Rover using Intel Edison and Python-Flask
This project is inspired by the Mars Curiosity Rover , I don't expect this rover to make it to Mars !! but you mimic it and implement some cool features using the Intel Edison. Having said that ,on mother Earth you can find industrial applications for this, to monitor hazardous condition.

For a step by step guide to make something similar refer to the instructable at
